# La-Bombonera-Repository
The project uses a Raspberry Pi to control a conveyor belt and a mini truck prototype, simulating an automated logistics process. Sensors and motors manage item detection, movement, and loading, while the Pi coordinates system communication, efficiency, and smart integration.
