## 📖 About the Project  
The project uses a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** to control a **conveyor belt** and a **mini truck prototype**, simulating an **automated logistics process**.  

### 🎯 Main Objective
Develop a conveyor belt with a fully automated process, where the finalizer (cart) features an **infrared PIR sensor** that sends a signal to interrupt delivery on the belt. The cart must be capable of unloading its products automatically.

### 🔧 Key Features
- **Automated Detection** → PIR sensor identifies when products reach the end point  
- **Smart Interruption** → System stops belt movement for unloading process  
- **Autonomous Unloading** → Cart automatically discharges its cargo  
- **IoT Integration** → Raspberry Pi Pico 2W handles all communication and control  
- **Real-time Monitoring** → Track the entire logistics process remotely
